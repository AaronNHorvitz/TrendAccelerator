# TrendAccelerator

**TrendAccelerator** aims to be a a TensorFlow-based Python library for scalable, GPU-accelerated time-series forecasting, featuring SARIMAX, ARIMAX, LOWESS, Exponential Smoothing, and preprocessing tools.

TrendAccelerator will power low-latency forecasting for large-scale time-series data, extensible to economics, IoT, and more. Built on TensorFlow for GPU acceleration, it will offer SARIMAX and ARIMAX with exogenous variables incorporating transfer functions, LOWESS for trend extraction, and Exponential Smoothing for lightweight modeling. It includes differencing, stationarity testing, and anomaly detection for robust preprocessing.
